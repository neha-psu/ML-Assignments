### Preprocessing ---- 1. Create training and test set:
data = np.genfromtxt('spambase.data', delimiter=',')
np.random.shuffle(data)
## grab the last column as target and rest as features
target = data[: ,-1]
features = data[:,0:-1]
total_features=features.shape[1]
## standerize the features --- mean = 0  and S.D =1
features = preprocessing.scale(features);
## Splitting training and test dataset
train_data, test_data, train_target, test_target = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)

print(train_data.shape, test_data.shape, train_target.shape, test_target.shape)

###prior probability for each class, 
###1 (spam) and 0 (not-spam) in the training data.
#### P(spam) should be approx 0.4 and P(not-spam) should be 0.6
train_data_length = len(train_data)
total_spam = 0
for i in range (train_data_length):
    if train_target[i] == 1 :
        total_spam +=1
        
probability_spam = total_spam/train_data_length
probability_not_spam = 1 - probability_spam
print("The probability of spam mail and not spam mail respectively is: ", probability_spam , probability_not_spam)


### Mean and Standard deviation for each feature
mean_of_Spam =[]
SD_spam =[]

for i in range (0,total_features):
    spam=[]
    NotSpam=[]
    for j in range (0,train_data_length):

###avoid a divide-by-zero error in Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes. (replace 0 SD with 0.0001 )

    predicted.append(np.argmax([Notspam_probability_testdata, spam_probability_testdata]))        

###calculate confusion_matrix, precision, Recall and accuracy.
accuracy = accuracy_score(test_target, predicted)
precision = precision_score(test_target, predicted)
recall = recall_score(test_target, predicted)

test_confusion_matrix = confusion_matrix(test_target,predicted)
